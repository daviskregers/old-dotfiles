# if input is negative it will subtract (?)

# if the new value is less than 1, we just set it to 1
# 0 is completely pitch black, just put pc to sleep
# if you want that.
if (( $new_value < 10 )); then  
        let brightness=10
# if the new value is greater than max brightness, set it to max brightness
